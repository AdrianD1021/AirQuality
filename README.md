Project Name: Global Earthquake Visualization
An overview of the project and its purpose: The project is to provide a 30-day overview of earthquake activity throughout the world to enhance understanding of: where earthquakes occur and their frequency; the methods used for recording and measuring earthquakes; How earthquake magnitude is determined. Our data was sourced from the USGS.gov website, which offers a variety of freely available GeoJSON files for download and use. However, the data couldn't be directly used with MongoDB Atlas, requiring conversion to JSON format via command line. Once the JSON file was uploaded to MongoDB, we granted access to our collection and utilized PyMongo in a Python file to execute queries. Subsequently, we employed Folium and Flask to leverage the data for creating the heatmap and integrating search functionality. Finally, we applied custom CSS/HTML adjustments to tailor the page to our preferences.
Instructions on how to use and interact with the project:
 - Heatmap
The heatmap depicts earthquake occurrences across the globe over the past 30 days. As evident from the visualization, the majority of stronger earthquakes are concentrated along the perimeters of the Pacific Ocean.This region corresponds to areas where the Pacific plate is being subducted beneath neighboring plates. Recently, Taiwan experienced a significant earthquake measuring 7.4 in magnitude, marking it as Taiwan's most powerful earthquake. The 4.8 magnitude earthquake that all of us felt in New Jersey last week is indicated by the orange dot on the map. Magnitudes of the earthquakes using the color scale is on the right side of the image.
 - Earthquake Interactive Search Map
The map features a search function allowing users to input earthquake magnitudes. Subsequently, relevant earthquake markers are displayed on the map. Clicking on a marker displays relevant earthquake details, including the title, latitude, longitude, magnitude, and a hyperlink to the corresponding USGS webpage for detailed information. Additionally, the markers are color-coded into three categories based on their magnitude: red for magnitudes greater than 6.5, blue for magnitudes less than or equal to 4.5, and blue for magnitudes less than 4.5. Furthermore, the map includes a visualization of an Earthquake Occurrence bar chart, depicting the count of earthquakes by magnitude and the heatmap above.
Ethical considerations: All the data were gathered from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website.The dataset comprises geographic information such as latitude, longitude, magnitude, and other pertinent data. As per USGS, the data is sourced from global and national seismic networks. Our objective in collecting this data was to offer a 30-day overview of earthquake activity worldwide. The dataset does not include any personally identifiable information (PII)
